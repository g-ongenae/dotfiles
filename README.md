# dotfiles

My small setup.

I'm taking ideas from:

- [@webpro](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles), see also his great article on [Medium](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789);
- [@mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles);
- [@holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles);
- [@paulirish](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles);
- and much more, from [_GitHub does dotfiles_](https://dotfiles.github.io/).

Still learning and building, though.

## Install

Run:

```bash
bash install.sh
```

## Help

Run:

```bash
