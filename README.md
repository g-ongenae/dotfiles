# dotfiles

My small setup.

I'm taking ideas from:
- [@webpro](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles), see also his great article on [Medium](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789);
- [@mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles);
- [@holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles);
- [@paulirish](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles);
- and much more, from https://dotfiles.github.io/.

Still learning and building, though.

## Install

Run:
```bash
bash install.sh
```
